For this project, my goal was to utilize 3d printing techniques in different ways to test new applications.  For my first iteration, I printed a template for making goldfish crackers
 off of Thingiverse.  Using this cutter, I rolled out a slab of low grade porclain and pressed the template into the soft surfaceto leave me easy to follow guides for my fish crackers. 
 Scaling the goldfish crackers up by 13% before printing allowed me to create crackers that, when fired to completion at 2232 degrees Ferenheight, 
 would shrink down to a realistic measurement.  Over time I hope to use this goldfish template multiple times, giving me the opportunity to apply the 
 motif to a number of different projects.

 My second and favorite iteration of this 3d printing technique was slightly more abstracted.  Inspired by the process of thermal modeling displayed by
 our printers,  I challenged myself to manipulate the PLA material myself, by hand with a heat gun in order to build shapes of my own by hand.  Taping the finalized shapes to the table to 
 discourage them from moving when I heat the rest of the piece, I slowly was able to morph a coil of PLA filament into a larger, lighter,and more unique form of printed plastic art.  The 
 project is enhanced by it's utilization of otherwise "unusable" materials, taking the remaining ends of unused filament rolls.  This keeps this beautiful, dynamic material out of our landfills
 and into the art world where we can draw upon it messages about (un)sustainability, commercialization, and thinking outside the box for solutions to these problems.
