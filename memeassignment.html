<h1> Memes, Culture, and Photoshop </h1>

<img class="img-fluid" src="memecomp.jpg" alt="Meme Compilation">

<p> This project combines five separate references to internet subculture, and combines them visually to deliver a cohesive message
	 readable only to those who have a prior understanding of each meme incorporated.  Some memes being more accessible than others,
	 this image is not approachable to all who come across it.   I found that making an image for such a niche audience felt isolating,
	 as if the image was working to make me feel apart from the rest of the world.  
      While missing the message to an underground meme may leave some with a feeling that they are being left out, I think there is value
      in the time these individuals spent not interacting with the internet enough to fully understand.  Social media, video, and game platforms 
      take up a significant amount of time and brain space that could be better used experiencing the world around us
     How much could I have done with the time I used to watch through the series pictured in the second quadrant?  How many thousands of
	 pages did the viewer need to read to understand the image in quadrant four?  How many hours of scrolling on social media sites did it take
	 to stumble across the "loss meme" overlayed across the entire image?  Is the underlying joke of this photoshopped image worth the time
	 investment it would take a viewer to fully understand the context and message I am trying to get across?  Is understanding it something 
	 worth celebrating?
