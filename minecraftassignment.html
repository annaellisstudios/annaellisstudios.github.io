<p>   Minecraft is a tool I have utilized for personal exploration for more than a decade now.  Thousands of hours have been spent
      in my life staring at the cubes that make up this digital environment.  In that time, I have seen it used for storytelling, 
      world building, community hosting, arena grounds, engineering, and of course, art creation.
     As a physical sculptor, I have always struggled to branch out into working in an abstracted digital space. I had thought that 
	 the medium would just never suit me. Minecraft having been a building block of my mental development as a child was the perfect
	 playground for me to delve deeper into how to create for the real world using only a mouse and keyboard to create the art that
	 my hands and clay alone could not.
