       This HTML Project comes from the depths of my anxious, obsessive brain that places so much consideration to the part 
	   that I play as an American in the destruction of our oceans over time.  These pages dive into the normalization of death,
	   destruction, and the abuse of our limited resources for the enjoyment of our communities.  Going through three obsessive 
	   thought patterns, the viewer is confronted with images relating to our warming oceans and the effect it has on millions 
	   of lives that we consider disposable.
â€‹       The viewer is also left to wonder, is the perspective cast upon them healthy? Is it making any change or is it ruminating 
       on thought patterns that only serve to bring them down?  Is their own perspective on the issue serving to ignore or further 
       destruction of our environment, or have they found a more productive way to cope?
